## On Bums

H. L. Mencken identified three types of itinerant workers in America:

- The _hobo_, simply a migratory laborer; he may take some longish holidays, but soon or late he returns to work.
- The _tramp_, who never works if it can be avoided; he simply travels.
- The _bum_, who neither works nor travels, save when impelled to motion by the police.

It is the for the Philadelphia sports iteration of the latter this website was created.

In late 2023, in the midst of an Eagles losing streak, a Phillies championship series defeat, and a lackluster Flyers season, PhillyBums was conceived by brothers Al and Tommy Maiocco as a way to express frustration with their favorite sports teams.

In true Negadelphian fashion, the brothers focused on the underperforming, underwhelming, and undeserving players on these teams, with the simple statement of “That guy is a bum”

Plenty of Philly sports websites focus on the analysis and achievement of their hometown teams, so why not try a place where you can let loose and rip a fumble-prone 3rd string running back a new one? Crack open a cold one and sit back to laugh at the bungling of the city’s top athletes.
